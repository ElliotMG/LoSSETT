# LoSSETT (Local Scale-to-Scale Energy Transfer Tool)

LoSSETT (the Local Scale-to-Scale Energy Transfer Tool) is a program designed to calculate local energy transfer across specified length scales. This repository contains source code in Python (.py files) and an interactive Jupyter Notebook that facilitates the use of the tool and the functions within the source code.

With thanks to Valerio Lembo (ISAC-CNR) for sharing some of the original MATLAB code developed with colleagues at CNRS ([Kuzzay et al. 2015](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-abstract/27/7/075105/103779), [Faranda et al. 2018](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/75/7/jas-d-17-0114.1.xml)).

## Features

- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook `LoSSETT_DYN.ipynb`**: Provides an interactive interface for using the tool, making it straightforward to run the program, and visualise the ouputs.
- **Modular Python Code**: Source code is organized into modules for ease of use and modification. In `LoSSETT_DYN.py` is the same content as the notebook but will run all at once as a normal python script. Be aware this may take some time (upwards of 10 minutes).
