# LoSSETT (Local Scale-to-Scale Energy Transfer Tool)

LoSSETT (the Local Scale-to-Scale Energy Transfer Tool) is a program designed to calculate local energy transfer across specified length scales. This repository contains source code in Python (.py files) and an interactive Jupyter Notebook that facilitates the use of the tool and the functions within the source code.

## Features

- **Local Energy Transfer Calculation**: Accurately computes the total local scale-to-scale energy transfer term.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook**: Provides an interactive interface for using the tool, making it easy to visualize and manipulate data.
- **Modular Python Code**: Source code is organized into modules for ease of use and modification.
